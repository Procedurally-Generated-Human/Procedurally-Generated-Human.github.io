## About Me

My full name is Mohammad Parsa Toopchinezhad. I am a Master's student at Concordia University studing CS. My research primarily focuses on applying Machine Learning (ML)--particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL)-- to solve various real-world problems. Currently, I am working with my supervisor, [Dr. Bentaleb](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rRq6FiAAAAAJ&hl=en), to develop adaptable ML agents for next-generation computer networks.
